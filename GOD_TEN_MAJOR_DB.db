There’s a place deer to me where I’m longing to be,
With my friends in the old country church
There with mother we went, and our Sundays were spent,
With my friends in the old country church.

Chorus:	
	Precious years, of memory, O what Joy they bring to me,
	How I long once more to be, with my friends in the old country church.
	
As a small country boy how my heart beat with Joy,
When I knelt in the old country church,
And the Saviour above, by His wonderful love,
Saved my Soul in the old country church.

How I wish that today, all the people would pray,
As we prayed in the old country church,
If they’d only confess Jesus surely would bless,
As He did in the old country church.

Oft my thoughts make me weep, for so many now sleep,
In their graves near the old country church,
And sometimes, I may rest with the friends I love best,
In a grave near the old country church.
