WE’LL MEET AGAIN SOME DAY
Some sweet day when life is over 
We shall meet on the other side 
We’ll sit by the banks of the river 
Where we’ll meet to part no more.

We shall meet beyond the river 
With our loved ones gone before 
We’ll sit by the banks of the river 
Where we’ll meet to part no more.

We shall meet beyond the river
We shall meet again someday
And we’ll walk thru the streets of that city 
Where no tears are wiped away.

May the precious Lord be with you 
As we part these words we say
Fill our hearts with joy and gladness 
Till we meet again someday.
